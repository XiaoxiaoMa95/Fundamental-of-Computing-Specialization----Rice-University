Mini-project description - Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock
Rock-paper-scissors is a hand game that is played by two people. The players count to three in unison and simultaneously "throw” one of three hand signals that correspond to rock, paper or scissors. The winner is determined by the rules:

Rock smashes scissors
Scissors cuts paper
Paper covers rock
Rock-paper-scissors is a surprisingly popular game that many people play seriously (see the Wikipedia article for details). Due to the fact that a tie happens around 1/3 of the time, several variants of Rock-Paper-Scissors exist that include more choices to make ties less likely.

Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock (RPSLS) is a variant of Rock-paper-scissors that allows five choices. Each choice wins against two other choices, loses against two other choices and ties against itself. Much of RPSLS's popularity is that it has been featured in 3 episodes of the TV series "The Big Bang Theory". The Wikipedia entry for RPSLS gives the complete description of the details of the game.

In our first mini-project, we will build a Python function rpsls(name) that takes as input the string name, which is one of "rock", "paper", "scissors", "lizard", or "Spock". The function then simulates playing a round of Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock by generating its own random choice from these alternatives and then determining the winner using a simple rule that we will next describe.

While Rock-paper-scissor-lizard-Spock has a set of ten rules that logically determine who wins a round of RPSLS, coding up these rules would require a large number (5x5=25) of if/elif/else clauses in your mini-project code. A simpler method for determining the winner is to assign each of the five choices a number:

0 — rock
1 — Spock
2 — paper
3 — lizard
4 — scissors
In this expanded list, each choice wins against the preceding two choices and loses against the following two choices (if rock and scissors are thought of as being adjacent using modular arithmetic).

In all of the mini-projects for this class, we will provide a walk through of the steps involved in building your project to aid its development. A template for your mini-project is available here. Please work from this template. (http://www.codeskulptor.org/#examples-rpsls_template.py)

Mini-project development process
1. Build a helper function 𝚗𝚊𝚖𝚎_𝚝𝚘_𝚗𝚞𝚖𝚋𝚎𝚛(𝚗𝚊𝚖𝚎) that converts the string 𝚗𝚊𝚖𝚎 into a number between 0 and 4 as described above. This function should use a sequence of 𝚒𝚏/𝚎𝚕𝚒𝚏/𝚎𝚕𝚜𝚎 clauses. You can use conditions of the form 𝚗𝚊𝚖𝚎 == '𝚙𝚊𝚙𝚎𝚛', etc. to distinguish the cases. To make debugging your code easier, we suggest including a final 𝚎𝚕𝚜𝚎 clause that catches cases when 𝚗𝚊𝚖𝚎 does not match any of the five correct input strings and prints an appropriate error message. You can test your implementation of 𝚗𝚊𝚖𝚎_𝚝𝚘_𝚗𝚞𝚖𝚋𝚎𝚛() using this name_to_number testing template. (Also available in the Code Clinic tips thread).(http://www.codeskulptor.org/#examples-name_to_number_template.py)

2. Next, you should build a second helper function 𝚗𝚞𝚖𝚋𝚎𝚛_𝚝𝚘_𝚗𝚊𝚖𝚎(𝚗𝚞𝚖𝚋𝚎𝚛) that converts a number in the range 0 to 4 into its corresponding name as a string. Again, we suggest including a final 𝚎𝚕𝚜𝚎 clause that catches cases when 𝚗𝚞𝚖𝚋𝚎𝚛 is not in the correct range. You can test your implementation of 𝚗𝚞𝚖𝚋𝚎𝚛_𝚝𝚘_𝚗𝚊𝚖𝚎() using this number_to_name testing template. (http://www.codeskulptor.org/#examples-number_to_name_template.py)

3. Implement the first part of the main function 𝚛𝚙𝚜𝚕𝚜(𝚙𝚕𝚊𝚢𝚎𝚛_𝚌𝚑𝚘𝚒𝚌𝚎). Print out a blank line (to separate consecutive games) followed by a line with an appropriate message describing the player's choice. Then compute the number 𝚙𝚕𝚊𝚢𝚎𝚛_𝚗𝚞𝚖𝚋𝚎𝚛 between 0 and 4 corresponding to the player's choice by calling the helper function 𝚗𝚊𝚖𝚎_𝚝𝚘_𝚗𝚞𝚖𝚋𝚎𝚛() using 𝚙𝚕𝚊𝚢𝚎𝚛_𝚌𝚑𝚘𝚒𝚌𝚎.

4. Implement the second part of 𝚛𝚙𝚜𝚕𝚜() that generates the computer's guess and prints out an appropriate message for that guess. In particular, compute a random number 𝚌𝚘𝚖𝚙_𝚗𝚞𝚖𝚋𝚎𝚛 between 0 and 4 that corresponds to the computer's guess using the function 𝚛𝚊𝚗𝚍𝚘𝚖.𝚛𝚊𝚗𝚍𝚛𝚊𝚗𝚐𝚎(). We suggest experimenting with 𝚛𝚊𝚗𝚍𝚛𝚊𝚗𝚐𝚎 in a separate CodeSkulptor window before deciding on how to call it to make sure that you do not accidently generate numbers in the wrong range. Then compute the name 𝚌𝚘𝚖𝚙_𝚌𝚑𝚘𝚒𝚌𝚎 corresponding to the computer's number using the function 𝚗𝚞𝚖𝚋𝚎𝚛_𝚝𝚘_𝚗𝚊𝚖𝚎() and print an appropriate message with the computer's choice to the console.

5. Implement the last part of 𝚛𝚙𝚜𝚕𝚜() that determines and prints out the winner. Specifically, compute the difference between 𝚌𝚘𝚖𝚙_𝚗𝚞𝚖𝚋𝚎𝚛 and 𝚙𝚕𝚊𝚢𝚎𝚛_𝚗𝚞𝚖𝚋𝚎𝚛 taken modulo five. Then write an 𝚒𝚏/𝚎𝚕𝚒𝚏/𝚎𝚕𝚜𝚎 statement whose conditions test the various possible values of this difference and then prints an appropriate message concerning the winner. If you have trouble deriving the conditions for the clauses of this 𝚒𝚏/𝚎𝚕𝚒𝚏/𝚎𝚕𝚜𝚎 statement, we suggest reviewing the "RPSLS" video which describes a simple test for determine the winner of RPSLS.
This will be the only mini-project in the class that is not an interactive game. Since we have not yet learned enough to allow you to play the game interactively, you will simply call your rpsls function repeatedly in the program with different player choices. You will see that we have provided five such calls at the bottom of the template. Running your program repeatedly should generate different computer guesses and different winners each time. While you are testing, feel free to modify those calls, but make sure they are restored when you hand in your mini-project, as your peer assessors will expect them to be there.

The output of running your program should have the following form:


Note that, for this initial mini-project, we will focus only on testing whether your implementation of rpsls() works correctly on valid input. For more helpful tips on implementing this mini-project, please visit the Code Clinic Tips page for this mini-project.

Grading rubric — 18 pts total (scaled to 100 pts)
Your peers will assess your mini-project according to the rubric given below. To guide you in determining whether your project satisfies each item in the rubric, please consult the video that demonstrates our implementation of "Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock". Small deviations from the textual output of our implementation are fine. You should avoid large deviations (such as using the Python function \color{red}{\verb|input|}input to input your guesses). Whether moderate deviations satisfy an item of the grading rubric is at your peers' discretion during their assessment.

Here is a break down of the scoring:

2 pts — A valid CodeSkulptor URL was submitted. Give no credit if solution code was pasted into the submission field. Give 1 pt if an invalid CodeSkulptor URL was submitted.
2 pts — Program implements the function 𝚛𝚙𝚜𝚕𝚜() and the helper function 𝚗𝚊𝚖𝚎_𝚝𝚘_𝚗𝚞𝚖𝚋𝚎𝚛() with plausible code. Give partial credit of 1 pt if only the function 𝚛𝚙𝚜𝚕𝚜() has plausible code.
1 pt — Running program does not throw an error.
1 pt — Program prints blank lines between games.
2 pts — Program prints "𝙿𝚕𝚊𝚢𝚎𝚛 𝚌𝚑𝚘𝚘𝚜𝚎𝚜 𝚙𝚕𝚊𝚢𝚎𝚛_𝚌𝚑𝚘𝚒𝚌𝚎" where 𝚙𝚕𝚊𝚢𝚎𝚛_𝚌𝚑𝚘𝚒𝚌𝚎 is a string of the form "𝚛𝚘𝚌𝚔", "𝚙𝚊𝚙𝚎𝚛", "𝚜𝚌𝚒𝚜𝚜𝚘𝚛𝚜", "𝚕𝚒𝚣𝚊𝚛𝚍" or "𝚂𝚙𝚘𝚌𝚔". An example of a complete line of output is "𝙿𝚕𝚊𝚢𝚎𝚛 𝚌𝚑𝚘𝚘𝚜𝚎𝚜 𝚜𝚌𝚒𝚜𝚜𝚘𝚛𝚜". Give 1 pt if program prints out number instead of string.
2 pts — Program prints "𝙲𝚘𝚖𝚙𝚞𝚝𝚎𝚛 𝚌𝚑𝚘𝚘𝚜𝚎𝚜 𝚌𝚘𝚖𝚙_𝚌𝚑𝚘𝚒𝚌𝚎" where 𝚌𝚘𝚖𝚙_𝚌𝚑𝚘𝚒𝚌𝚎 is a string of the form "𝚛𝚘𝚌𝚔", "𝚙𝚊𝚙𝚎𝚛", "𝚜𝚌𝚒𝚜𝚜𝚘𝚛𝚜", "𝚕𝚒𝚣𝚊𝚛𝚍" or "𝚂𝚙𝚘𝚌𝚔". An example of a complete line of output is "𝙲𝚘𝚖𝚙𝚞𝚝𝚎𝚛 𝚌𝚑𝚘𝚘𝚜𝚎𝚜 𝚜𝚌𝚒𝚜𝚜𝚘𝚛𝚜". Give 1 pt if program prints out number instead of string.
1 pt — Computer's guesses vary between five calls to 𝚛𝚙𝚜𝚕𝚜() in each run of the program.
1 pt — Computer's guesses vary between runs of the program.
3 pts — Program prints either "𝙿𝚕𝚊𝚢𝚎𝚛 𝚊𝚗𝚍 𝚌𝚘𝚖𝚙𝚞𝚝𝚎𝚛 𝚝𝚒𝚎!", "𝙿𝚕𝚊𝚢𝚎𝚛 𝚠𝚒𝚗𝚜!" or "𝙲𝚘𝚖𝚙𝚞𝚝𝚎𝚛 𝚠𝚒𝚗𝚜!" to report outcome. (1 pt for each message.)
3 pts — Program chooses correct winner according to RPSLS rules. Please manually examine 5 cases for correctness. If all five cases are correct, award 3 pts; four cases correct award 2 pts; one to three cases correct award 1 pt; no cases correct award 0 pts.
