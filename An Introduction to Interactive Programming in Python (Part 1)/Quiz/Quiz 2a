1. What typically calls an event handler?

Some code that you didn't write which generates the event.
Correct


2. In CodeSkulptor, how many event handlers can be running at the same time?

1
Correct


3. What are the three parts of a frame? Refer to the video on SimpleGUI.


Canvas
Correct

Status Area
Correct

Control Area
Correct


4. For the SimpleGUI-based programs in this course, we recommended breaking down an interactive Python program into seven parts. Below, these parts are listed alphabetically.

1. Create frame
2. Define classes
3. Define event handlers
4. Initialize global variables
5. Define helper functions
6. Register event handlers
7. Start frame and timers
However, in lecture, we recommended a particular ordering of these parts.
Enter 7 numbers in the range 1â€“7, separated only by spaces, to indicate the recommended ordering of the preceding elements of an interactive Python program. For example, if you think that the first action in your program should be to register your event handlers, enter 6 as the first number in the sequence.

4 5 2 3 1 6 7
Correct 


5. Assume the following global definition is part of your program.
x = 5

If each of the following function definitions are also part of your program, which of them needs a global x declaration?
You can try each definition in CodeSkulptor.

def a(y):
    x = x + y
    return y
Correct
This example needs a global declaration. A global variable is assigned within a function, so you need a global declaration.


6. Consider the following code.

count = 0

def square(x):
    global count
    count += 1
    return x**2

print square(square(square(square(3))))
What is the value of \color{red}{\verb|count|}count at the end? Enter a number. (You can double check your answer in CodeSkulptor if you wish.)

4
Correct
Correct. Each time square is called the global variable count is increased by 1.


7. Consider the following code.

a = 3
b = 6

def f(a):
    c = a + b
    return c

Which names occur in the global scope?


a
Correct

b
Correct

f
Correct
The function name \verb|f|f has global scope.


8. For the upper coding, which names occur in a local scope?

c
Correct

a
Correct


9. Which of the following are valid calls to create_frame?

f = simplegui.create_frame("My Frame", 100, 100)
frame = simplegui.create_frame("Testing", 200, 200, 300)
