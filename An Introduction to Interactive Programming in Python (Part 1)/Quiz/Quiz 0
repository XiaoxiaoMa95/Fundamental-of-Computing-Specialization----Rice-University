4.  Which of the following arithmetic expressions are syntactically correct?
Try each of them in CodeSkulptor.

(7 - 2) / (3 ** 2)
Correct
This example has correct syntax.

(8 + (1 + (2 * 4) - 3))
Correct
This example has correct syntax.

5. You would like to make it so that the variable\ounces has the value 16, thus representing one pound. What simple Python statement will accomplish this?

ounces = 16
Correct

6. A gram is equal to 0.035274 ounces. Assume that the variable \color{red}{\verb|mass_in_ounces|}mass_in_ounces has a value representing a given mass in ounces. Which Python statement below uses the variable mass_in_ounces to compute an equivalent mass mass_in_grams expressed in grams?
Think about it mathematically, but also test these expressions in CodeSkulptor3. If you are still confused, you might check out this student tutorial video by Kelly on unit conversions.

mass_in_grams = mass_in_ounces / 0.035274
Correct


7. Which of the following can be used as a variable name?
Try using each in CodeSkulptor.

MYnumber
Correct
This is a valid variable name. However, convention says that Python variables shouldn't start with a capital letter.

number123
Correct
This is a valid variable name.


8. Assume you have values in the variables x andy. Which statement(s) would result in x having the sum of the current values of x and y?
Test your answer in CodeSkulptor.

x = x + y
Correct

x += y
Correct


9. Python file names traditionally end in what characters after a period? Don't include the period.
